# The agent scripts

Depth behind AGENTS.md, which has the commands themselves.

`agent-scripts/` wraps the Gradle test tasks so the loop does not have to be
rediscovered from the build files each time. Nothing in the build depends on
them.

- `test.sh` — the test driver. Conversion only by default (`untilConversion`
  plus the locality tests, which have no verification stage), `--verify` for the
  full pipeline, `--verify-changed` for `./gradlew update` (convert everything,
  verify only where conversion output changed), `--update-goldens` to regenerate
  goldens and report what they now say.
- `check-all.sh` — `check`, `pre-commit` and the testData checks together.
  `--rerun` re-executes tests Gradle considers current.
- `check-testdata.sh` — golden files with no source, and empty golden files.

`test.sh` and `check-all.sh` take `--help`, and need `python3` on PATH because
the test results they report from are XML; `check-testdata.sh` needs nothing but
a checkout.

## Exit codes

`check-all.sh` reports each of its three checks as passed, failed or skipped. A
skip means the run covered less than the command promises, and the gap is in the
setup rather than in the code, so it gets its own exit code rather than being
folded into either 0 or 1.

## Recovering the diff

Gradle's cross-JVM result serialization strips the expected/actual values off a
golden-file assertion before they reach the console.
`DumpAssertionDiffExtension`, registered on the compiler-plugin test classpath
by `formver.compiler-plugin/test-resources/`, catches them inside the test JVM
instead. It is registered for every run and stays inert unless
`SNAKT_TEST_DUMP_DIR` is set, which `test.sh` does. The locality module has no
test fixtures on its classpath, so its failures go to the HTML report instead.

Only golden-file assertions carry values to recover. For a thrown exception
`test.sh` prints the failure from the JUnit XML.

Diffs are printed with source-position offsets replaced by `(_,_)`, so a method
that only moved because of an edit earlier in the file drops out.

## Patterns

`GenerateTestsKt` capitalizes a testData file's stem and turns dashes into
underscores to form the method name, so `assign_local.kt` backs
`testAssign_local` and `non-local-returns.kt` backs `testNon_local_returns`.
Gradle's `--tests` filter is case-sensitive, and the scripts convert for you.

## Regenerating

`--update-goldens` regenerates and then prints what each golden now says.
Regeneration records whatever the run produced, except a change in a function's
verification outcome.

A function's outcome is failed when a verifier diagnostic lies inside it,
skipped when it carries `VERIFICATION_SKIPPED`, and clean otherwise; clean
covers both verified and not selected for verification. The expected outcome is
read from the markers the `.kt` already has. When any function's outcome
differs, the test writes no golden at all and fails with
`OutcomeChangeRefused`, naming each function and quoting the new diagnostics;
`test.sh` lists these under "not regenerated" and exits 1. A failure that
starts verifying is a change too: a negative test that stops failing has lost
what it tests. The check is `VerificationOutcomes` in
`formver.compiler-plugin/test-fixtures/org/jetbrains/kotlin/formver/plugin/services/`.

`--update-goldens --record-outcomes <pattern>` lets outcomes change, for the
one test that is meant to record a new failure, skip or fix. It takes a pattern
so that it covers only that test, and prints the marker changes uncut.
