/**
 * Represents a subtree in which a different subtree may appear multiple times.
 *
 * This is a complicated construction. There are cases when we want to use a source-level construction multiple times in the target
 * without recomputing it. For example, `f() ?: g()` should be translated to `if (f() != null) f() else g()`, but only one call
 * to `f()` should be produced per usage of `f() ?: g()`. Note that not all sharing should be tread like this: for example, we share
 * the condition node of a `while` loop, but it should be evaluated each time separately.
 *
 * This class contains the context that the sharing happens in, while the `sharedExp` is the result of the expression that is shared.
 *
 * This class should be used via the `share` function below. Do not do anything funny, or it will not work.

 * This solution has some bugs: if a shared expression references a variable and that variable is modified
 * between the shared parts, the second occurrence may have a different value than the first. We can fix this
 * quite easily by using a fresh variable every time, but that would add unreasonable bloat to many programs.
